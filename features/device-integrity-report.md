How to access:

1. Settings > My Account > Phone Manager > Device Integrity

&#x20;2\. When in home screen menu: Swipe down (to open the settings bar) > Swipe down again (to open the notification bar) > Press the shield icon on the bottom right corner
{% endhint %}

### Software integrity

The local device policies and installed software (apps and OS) are compared to the policies saved on the server. Any discrepancies are reported with the user being alerted.&#x20;

The user can access detailed logs in case there is a discrepancy, to understand where the discrepancy is coming from.&#x20;

### Hardware integrity

Secure OS utilizes a hardware-based device attestation designed to prevent the device from starting in case it has been rooted or jailbroken. The user can access a report of the components checked.&#x20;
